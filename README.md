# Excel Automation

This Python script automates tasks related to Excel spreadsheets using the `openpyxl` library for data manipulation and `googletrans` for translation.

## Features

- Converts English names and addresses to Gujarati.
- Retrieves and formats dates and special occasions (Tithis) in both English and Gujarati.
- Automates the creation of a new Excel workbook based on processed data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `openpyxl` library (`pip install openpyxl`)
- `googletrans` library (`pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your Excel file:
   - Ensure the original Excel file (`input.xlsx`) is in the project directory.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python excel_automation.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to specify file locations and options.

## Instructions

1. The script assumes the first sheet of the Excel file (`S1`) is date-wise display data.
2. Do not open the destination file (`new_output.xlsx`) during script execution to avoid conflicts.
3. Data processing starts from the second row of the sheet (`S1`).

## Additional Notes

- This script is designed for specific use cases in industries where bilingual Excel reports are required.
- Ensure the Excel file format and content match the expected structure for accurate automation.
